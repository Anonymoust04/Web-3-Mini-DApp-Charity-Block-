# SolanaWallet

A modern Solana wallet interface built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Framer Motion, and v0 AI. This project was created as part of a frontend development workshop to showcase the integration of development, design, and web3 technologies.

## Features

- **Seamless Wallet Connection**: Easily connect your Solana wallet using `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`.
- **Token & Balance Management**: View your public key and current SOL balance.
- **Request Airdrop**: Get testnet SOL for development purposes.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with TailwindCSS for mobile-first design.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations with Framer Motion.
